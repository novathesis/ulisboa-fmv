# Abstract: nova-fct-novathesis-v7.10.1

This is a customized LaTeX template for theses and reports at **Faculdade de Ciências e Tecnologia da Universidade NOVA de Lisboa (NOVA FCT)**, following the most recent [NOVA FCT guidelines (in Portuguese)](https://www.fct.unl.pt/estudante/informacao-academica/teses-e-dissertacoes). 

This template is a streamlined and fine-tuned version of the robust **NOVAthesis framework (v7.10.1)**, trimmed down and optimized to provide NOVA FCT students with a streamlined experience, meeting NOVA FCT's academic formatting standards without the complexity of the original multi-institution template. 

### Key Features:

* **NOVA FCT-Ready:** Pre-configured with the correct margins, cover page styles, and fonts required by NOVA FCT.
* **Streamlined:** Unnecessary files and configurations for other universities and languages (other than PT and EN) have been removed, making the template lighter and easier to navigate.
* **Modern Academic Standards:**
    * **AI Disclosure:** Integrated support for the new Artificial Intelligence Disclosure Statement.
    * **SDGs:** Visual enumeration of the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) for modern research impact reporting.
* **User-Friendly Design:** Optimized for both LaTeX beginners and power users, ensuring a clean and efficient workflow.

**Authors:** João M. Lourenço (with contributions from many others).
